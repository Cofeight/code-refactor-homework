code-refactor README
Chris Ochota-Feight

I reviewed the assignment requirements, then reviewed the index and style files. Within Style.css: I noted the attributes of the different classes and ids defined within the style.css as /*commenting out*/. I also consolidated classes that shared the same attributes. Within index.html, I redefined the    /*div*/ indicators to better conform to HTML semantics. I also implemented proper indentation throughout the documentation for improved readability. Lastly, I included my GitHub link at the bottom of the page. I am sure there are still mistakes, and nuemerous ways to improve the flow of both the .html and .css files.
